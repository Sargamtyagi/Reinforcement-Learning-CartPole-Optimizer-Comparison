Implemented a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent to solve the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent was trained using neural networks with experience replay and epsilon-greedy exploration. Achieved stable performance with a maximum score of 283 by balancing the pole for extended timesteps. Experimented with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epsilon decay to analyze their effect on convergence and performance.
